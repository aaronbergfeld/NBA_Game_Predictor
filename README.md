# NBA Game Predictor

This repository contains scripts and models used to predict NBA games.

## Setup using `uv`

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package installer that can be used as a drop-in replacement for `pip`. The project is configured with a `pyproject.toml` and a `requirements.txt` so you can install dependencies with `uv`.

1. Install `uv` if you do not already have it:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv venv .venv
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Once the environment is created, activate it and run the Python scripts as needed.
